## Inside Scoop

<br/>

I'm a JavaScript Developer focused on building scalable, high-performance web applications with React, Node.js, and Next.js. I’m passionate about finance, health, and technology, and I bring a detail-oriented mindset and strong grasp of the Software Development Lifecycle to every project. I thrive on solving complex problems through a balance of analytical thinking and creative engineering, consistently delivering clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
<br><br>
My toolkit includes RESTful APIs, server-side rendering, real-time features, and performance optimization using tools like Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools. I follow best practices in testing, version control, and code scalability, and I value strong communication and collaboration.
<br><br>
My goal is to join a forward-thinking team where I can build impactful digital products, grow alongside talented developers, and contribute to solving meaningful real-world problems through code.

  In addition to the original scope of the project, there were many additional tasks, and we managed to accomplish a lot. Communication was at the highest level. Even when we encountered obstacles, finding a common solution was not a problem. I am sure that after this project, we both had some valuable takeaways. Great job!

  I've been hiring developers for years, but Diogo is by far the best one I've ever worked with. He is always available to talk and always sends updates regarding the project. If all developers were like him, it would make my life much easier.
  
  The code and consistency of the project were amazing, and it surprised the management with all the suggestions he gave us. The project was delivered 2 days before the deadline.
  
  Will be hiring again for sure!
  
  Thanks Diogo!
